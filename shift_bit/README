The shift bit is to implement the shiftbit with derection of left and right.
The 3 different file is to 512 bit and 256 bit, the shift_right is easy to implement by using the library function in Intel Intrinsic Guide.
But the shift_left of 256 bit need to be done by the shift_right func in the library.
So the mvbit_256_left.c is worth learning. 
Come on!
